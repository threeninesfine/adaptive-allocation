\section{Acknowledgments}
I wish to thank my thesis advisor Amalia for her support both in providing input, support, and direction for my thesis work. 
She has been a steadfast advocate on my part in navigating graduate school, and it would be unimaginable for me to consider finishing without her support.

I would like to thank Gitana for her outstanding work to make us students feel welcome throughout graduate school.
Her being supportive and understanding went beyond her role as student advisor and I am very thankful for her help. 

Also wish to thank Scott Emerson for the thesis idea and for inspiring bravery to ideas despite opposing viewpoints.
I am grateful for his role in shaping my journey towards becoming a better critical thinker. 

I want to thank both my parents Yen and Steve for their support throughout the graduate school process and hanging in there with me to the end.
