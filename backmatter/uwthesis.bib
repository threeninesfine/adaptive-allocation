	number={5},
	pages={443--453},

	annote    = {Taves (1974) proposed the initial method of minimization for controlling marginal imbalance over several (3 or more) prognostic factors in a small sample setting (n of 50). The approach sequentially allocates incoming patients deterministically to the treatment category that minimizes the overall unweighted sum of imbalance given the new assignment. The assignment is performed deterministically; assignment is randomized only when assignment to either treatment category results in the same imbalance.}

	author={Pocock, Stuart J and Simon, Richard},
	journal={Biometrics},
	pages={103--115},
	year={1975},
	publisher={JSTOR},
	annote = {Pocock and Simon (1975) proposed a generalization to Taves' minimization method, which allowed for weighting of covariate imbalances to incorporate relative importance of balancing one factor over another. Additionally, the approach considers a non-deterministic allocation vector, with allocation probability weighted to minimize the imbalance function. Simulation results in small trials (n of 50) and 3 to 8 (potentially binary) covariates indicate the proposed minimization method controls the expected probability and magnitude of imbalance relative to simple (complete) randomization and stratified randomization.}
